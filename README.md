# DataCamp Associate Data Analyst Case Study Project - Food Claims Process
> **BY ABDULRAHEEM BASHIR**

## Introduction
This case study is about a fast food restaurant in Brazil where consumers file claims against such as food poisoning. Vivendo fast food is the name of the fast food to be used in this case study.

Vivendo is a fast food chain in Brazil with over 200 outlets. As with many fast food establishments, customers make claims against the company. For example, they blame Vivendo for suspected food poisoning.

The legal team, who processes these claims, is currently split across four locations. The new head of the legal department wants to see if there are differences in the time it takes to close claims across the locations.
